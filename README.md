# FilmFinder

## Description
The motivation behind creating this app was so that people could have a way to save time on looking for a movie and instead use
that time watching a movie. Sometimes it feels as if you've spent over an hour looking for a movie and then you give up after
not having found what you are looking for. The goal of our app is to give you one place that narrows your search down to what you
are looking for while searching multiple streaming platforms at once. Through this project we have learned how valuable of a
resource APIs are when it comes to making an app like ours.

## Installation

After selecting a genre the user will then be able to select a content rating (PG, PG-13, ect.) and a decade from which the movie was released. The user can choose both a content rating and decade or just one of the two.
